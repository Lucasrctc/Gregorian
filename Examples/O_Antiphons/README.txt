This example shows the Great O Antiphons arranged in 4 different ways using the same scores as their sources.

Proof.tex: This one simply prints each score once.  This makes it ideal for checking to proofing the text and music to make sure everything is as indended.  It also contains the Magnificat tone and text as it was found in the source.

O_Antiphons_booklet.tex: This file creates a booklet on letter paper containing just the O Antiphons themselves.  Each antiphon has its own page and the booklet design incorporates artwork, font variations, and color to improve the look.

Magnificat_booklet.tex: This file is a companion to O_Antiphons_booklet, containing the text of the Magnificat fully written out with the notes and formatted into a booklet on letter paper.  By having it as a separate booklet, there is less page flipping in use.

O_Antiphons_expanded.tex: This file provides a separate 2-page handout for each O Antiphon which includes the Magnificat text.  This makes it ideal for creating a handout which is specific to a particular day.
